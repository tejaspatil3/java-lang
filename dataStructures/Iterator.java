// Java Iterator
// An Iterator is an object that can be used to loop through collections, like ArrayList and HashSet. It is called an "iterator" because "iterating" is the technical term for looping.

// To use an Iterator, you must import it from the java.util package.

// Getting an Iterator
// The iterator() method can be used to get an Iterator for any collection:

// Removing Items from a Collection
// Iterators are designed to easily change the collections that they loop through. The remove() method can remove items from a collection while looping.
