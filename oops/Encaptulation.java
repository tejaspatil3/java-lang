// The meaning of Encapsulation, is to make sure that "sensitive" data is hidden from users. To achieve this, you must:

// declare class variables/attributes as private
// provide public get and set methods to access and update the value of a private variable

public class Encaptulation {
    public static void main(String[] args) {
        
        // data hiding 
       // using access modifiers
       // making them private to encaptulate
       // hiding outer classed from making unnecessary changes
    }
