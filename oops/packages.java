package packages;


// Java Packages & API
// A package in Java is used to group related classes. Think of it as a folder in a file directory. We use packages to avoid name conflicts, and to write a better maintainable code. Packages are divided into two categories:

// Built-in Packages (packages from the Java API)
// User-defined Packages (create your own packages)
// Built-in Packages
// The Java API is a library of prewritten classes, that are free to use, included in the Java Development Environment.

// The library contains components for managing input, database programming, and much much more. The complete list can be found at Oracles website: https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/.

// The library is divided into packages and classes. Meaning you can either import a single class (along with its methods and attributes), or a whole package that contain all the classes that belong to the specified package.

// To use a class or a package from the library, you need to use the import keyword:

// import package.name.Class;   // Import a single class
// import package.name.*;   // Import the whole package
